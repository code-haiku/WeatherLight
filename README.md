# WeatherLight
Weather conditions visualisation using a traffic light.

I am a motorcycle rider and use my bike almost every day if the weather is not extremely bad to commute to the office. Every day I have to decide between riding my bike or taking the train by looking at the weather forecast. And because I am too lazy to do the same thing over and over again I decided to automate it and visualize weather conditions using a traffic light. So now I just look at the traffic light every morning and it shows me whether weather conditions are suitable for a ride.
